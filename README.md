## The Data Pipeline
![Alt text](/Data-Pipeline)

### Motivation
- Back in the early 2000s, the stock portfolio updation was very slow. But today, instantaneous updation is vital
as quick decisions make a faster and profiting trade. That is what I tried to replicate in this project.

### What is Stock-a-folio?
- A highly scalable, low-latent and always available stock portfolio managmeent application.
- It can handle 10 million users and a throughput of 20,000 trades per second. Yet the portfolio is updated in the blink of an eye.
- Built using all distributed open-source technologies.

### The Stack
 - Built on Amazon Webservices EC2
